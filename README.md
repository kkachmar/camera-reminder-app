# camera-reminder-app
App concept to remind users about webcam use to maintain digital privacy.

##About:
This is a very simple prototype of an app developed for a Hackathon themed: Digital Privacy. 
In order to reduce human error in operating a webcam, especially with video conferencing programs being increasingly used during the coronavirus pandemic, this app would recognize when cameras are being left on and remind users to turn off cameras when stepping away from their computers.

##How to run:
No external libraries were used. I recommend using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse to run this project. Just download and have the IDE compile and run the program.
